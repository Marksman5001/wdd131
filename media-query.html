            <h2>Alma 30:44</h2>
            <p>But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the 
                testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea,
                and all things denote there is a God; yea even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea and its motion, yea,
                and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator

            <p>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not;
                and it shall be given him.
